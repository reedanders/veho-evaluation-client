### Veho Evaluation App - Reed Anderson

This app is a submission for the Veho Evaluation. The requirements and wireframes for this app are in /technical_project.pdf.

### Running the app

The boilerplate for this app was created with `create react app` and additionally uses the material-ui component library. 

To install any dependencies, run the following:

```
npm install

```

The start the app locally, run the following:

```
npm start
```

### Overview of implementation

The conversation application is very similar in structure to a dashboard app. It has a fixed sidebar with links and a larger content area that updates based on which link is selected. Local data is simulated with a dummy api call. I also had time to make the app mobile first, meaning the sidebar is collapsibe at a mobile media size.
